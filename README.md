<h1>Excel to PostgreSQL Data Import</h1>
This project aims to import data from an Excel sheet into a PostgreSQL database. It provides two approaches: one using threads for parallel processing and the other without using threads. Both approaches are implemented in Java using the Apache POI library for reading Excel files and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver for database connectivity.

  <li>  Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher</li>
<li> Apache Maven (for building and managing dependencies)</li>
<li> PostgreSQL database server installed and running</li>
<li> Apache POI and PostgreSQL JDBC driver dependencies (automatically resolved by Maven)</li>
  </ul>
